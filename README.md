# pdfExtractAndOutputCsv
An app that takes PDF files as inputs, digest them (extract some specific datas from them) and output csv files as results.

The need was to extract specific data from invoices and export those data as csv files.

It's all done in an overkill architecture : Springboot / Java Fx packaged with Launch4J, only because that was so convenient for me...
